Learn how to use Blanket.js for Code Coverage

## Intro

Blanket.js is a JavaScript code coverage library that works both 
in-browser and with nodejs.

I recently wrote a tutorial for 
[Istanbul](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-istanbul) 
(another JavaScript Code Coverage tool) but sadly Istanbul is not very good
with testing browser code.

Blanket.js has a *stated aim* of working in the browser and that's what we
are going to focus on today.
